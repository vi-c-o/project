VAE for Image Recovery

This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for recovering images affected by packet loss distortion. The goal is to reconstruct high-quality images from distorted versions using deep learning techniques.
Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/macedocja/uav-images-packet-loss-distortion.

Code for Benchmark Comparisons

To compare the performance of the VAE with other models or techniques, you can refer to the following repository on GitHub: https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE. The code in this repository provides a benchmark VAEs models.
Usage

    Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can check the requirements.txt file for the necessary libraries.

    Download the dataset images.zip and distorted.zip

    Run the following command to execute the VAE for image recovery:


    python3 main.py config_file.json

    Make sure you have prepared the config_file.json with the appropriate configurations.

    Before running the code, ensure that the distorted directory and images.zip files exist in the project directory. These are required for training and evaluating the VAE.

Results

We have deployed an API that provides some results from the trained VAE model. You can access the API and explore the recovered images at the following link: VAE Image Recovery API https://webapp-33aygxoera-uc.a.run.app/
